## Low-Cost Rainfall Sensors

For areas of the world not covered by traditional rainfall sensors, what kind of device could be created to give *some* information about rainfall and rainfall-related statistics?

How expensive would it be to build a device that can:
* Communicate with a central base station over distances?
* Know its own location within 1 km^2?
* Know the relative humidity at its location?
* Have some fuzzy knowledge of how much rain is falling on its location?
* Survive being dropped from a height of 1,000 m?
* Be made entirely of biodegradable or inert materials?
